# ESP-IDF Template

This is a template application for using Wifi Station | Wifi SoftAP | Ethernet with TCP IP Stack. This is to be used with Espressif IoT Development Framework.

Please check ESP-IDF docs for getting started instructions.

### About mDNS

The IP address of an IoT device may vary from time to time, so itâ€™s impracticable to hard code the IP address in the webpage. In this template-project, we use the `mDNS` to parse the domain name `esp-home.local`, so that we can alway get access to the web server by this URL no matter what the real IP address behind it. See [here](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/api-reference/protocols/mdns.html) for more information about mDNS.

**Notes: mDNS is installed by default on most operating systems or is available as separate package.**

### Hardware Required

To run this template-project, you need an ESP32 dev board (e.g. ESP32-WROVER Kit, ESP32-Ethernet-Kit) or ESP32 core board (e.g. ESP32-DevKitC). An extra JTAG adapter might also needed if you choose to deploy the website by semihosting. For more information about supported JTAG adapter, please refer to [select JTAG adapter](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/api-guides/jtag-debugging/index.html#jtag-debugging-selecting-jtag-adapter). Or if you choose to deploy the website to SD card, an extra SD slot board is needed.
